                            <p>Hi! My name is Elaine and I am a third year year computer science major at California Polytechnic State University. My main technical focus full-stack web development and my other areas of interest include artificial intelligence, and virtual reality.</p>
                
                            <p>After discovering my passion for web development, I decided to start participating in hackathons to collaborate with other students to use technology to tackle social problems. So far this year, I have developed several web apps intended to improve the lives of people in our community, such as increasing safety of students living on campus, helping families with children who have autism, and providing an extra resource for students with hearing impairments.</p>

                            <p>I have worked part time as an IT programmer student assistant and have created a web application to simplify the process of applying for student government at Cal Poly. I am currently interning year-round at Amazon, working with React, Java, and DynamoDB to create new features for an internal app.</p>
                            
                            <p>Asides from web development, I am also highly involved in the women in technology community at Cal Poly through clubs such as Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and Women Involved in Software and Hardware (WISH). I am also on the directors team of UX Fest, which is Cal Poly's first UX competition founded by women of color that aims to create an inclusive space for students to learn more about UX.</p>
                
                            <p>My side passions include photography, video editing, desigining, and making piano covers. </p>

                        <p><u>User Preferences Project</u>: The goal of this project was to create a user preferences menu where users can set a desired behavior for the justidiction editor and have that preference saved and persist between uses. I worked on creating the DynamoDB table, adding it to the cloud formation template, and using the AWS console to test code changes from my personal SAM stack. I learned a lot about creating APIs to get and receive data from DynamoDB, and also about error handling and the best practices on how to do error handling. I deepened my understanding on the redux store and how it is integrated with React components.</p>

                        <p><u>Jurisdiction History Page Project</u>: The goal of this project was to create a page that displays all of the modifications made to a jurisdiction including the date, time, and author of the change. I created several mockups on how to visualize the data and held a design review meeting with over 10 team members. I received a lot of feedback from the meeting and applied them to improve my mockups and API design. I improved my skills on React (specifically the react-table) and understanding the overall React lifecycle. I also learned quite a bit about the Facade pattern in Spring for the web app to to interact with subsystems.</p>

                        <p>- Created a mobile app that monitors the spread of COVID-19 and notifies the user if they are vulnerable to the virus.</p>
                        <p>- For this project, I used Ionic framework to create the front end. I also used Firebase and TypeScript to create the login page and store the user's email, password, and first/last name. I learned quite a bit about how to use services such as the Firebase authentication service. This was my first time working with Firebase and Ionic together so I had a lot of trouble trying to fetch the data from the backend to send to the front end. </p>

                        <p>- Cowovid19 is an app that visualizes Covid-19 cases in california over time. By keeping track of changes in metrics such as hospital capacity over the past few months, we can begin to understand which counties will need the most support in the days to come. Users who have the means to donate ventilators to hospitals would be directed to resources that take them there.</p>
                        <p>- I worked in a team of 5 and used D3.js, Flask, and jQuery to build this web app. I mainly worked on the front end to color code the map to indicate the severity of the COVID-19 cases in each county.</p>

                        <p>- Students are able to report incidents and view reported incidents on a map. Law enforcement or University Police are able to log into a more detailed dashboard of non-emergency reports and respond appropriately. This enables immediate communication between UPD and students regarding active incidents. </p>
                        <p>- For this project I assisted with the front-end development using Bootstrap to create a responsive UI.</p>

                        <p>-For this project, I used HTML, CSS and AngularJS to create the user interface. This was my first time working with Angular so it was a little challenging. However, I was able to solve most of my problems within the 24 hour time limit, and I definitely learnt a lot. </p>

                        <p>- Organized Cal Poly’s first UX competition for participants to learn more about UX in an inclusive environment. I've been interested in UX alongside web development and I thought starting this club would also allow me to learn other people's perspectives on UX and what it means to them on top of helping other students discover their passion for UX.</p>
                        <p>- I have set up and attended meetings with other UX clubs within campus and within California to try a grow the UX community by by inviting them to collaborate with us.</p>
                        <p>- Created a sponsorship pitch deck and reached out to sponsors to get speakers and funding for our events.</p>
